# Simple NodeJS+Express (ejs) code to read in new customer data and add to a MongoDB colleciton

This repository is a simple started code NodeJS+Express projet that has a / (index.js ->index.ejs view) which shows a 
simple form to gather data for a new customer
Here is what it looks like

After entering in data and hitting "Go" the /saveNewCustomer route (index.js) is invoked as a POST request, this invokes
the controller code in controllers/database.js. This will read in the POST form data of the customer's name and email 
and save this to a MongoDB Atlas database called "shippingsite" in a collection called "customers".   The results will
be that a new document with this name and email is added to the customers collection.

It will respond with a simple welcome to the new customer.

## IMPORTANT:  this is simple code  and it does not check if the customer email already exists --so it will stupidly 
create a new customer each time regardless if it is the same information.  THIS should obviously be hanged
## IMPORTANT:  you will need to create your own databaseConnection.js file in the controllers directory that contains
the following code

>module.exports = { uri: 'mongodb+srv://YOURLogin:YOURPassword@YOURClustername.WHATEVER.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority' };
